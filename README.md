# Maplify

Track your outdoor workouts with precision—powered by Leaflet.js and pure JavaScript.


## Introduction 

**Maplify** is a sleek, interactive web application that helps you log, visualize, and manage your running and cycling workouts on a real-time map. Built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks!) and **Leaflet.js** for geolocation and map rendering, Maplify provides a responsive and intuitive interface for fitness tracking—right in the browser.
